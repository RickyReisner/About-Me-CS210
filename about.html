      <h1>Ricky Reisner</h1>
      <p>I'm a golfer, and that takes up a majority of my time. 
        I enjoy hanging out with friends and when I can play video games to relax.
         My life consists of basically golf and school. I am a CS major and I enjoy
        it even though it can be challenging at times. It is the most mentally
      challenging sport that I have played by far and it has taught me a lot. Thats
    really all I got, Golf is basically my life and I love it.</p>

    <p>This is my family. They are the most important thing in this world to me
      and they are the reason for where I'm at today. They all do more for me than
      I could ever thank them for <menu>
